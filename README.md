# Why is this forked?

This is forked to implement the ability to simply pass the values to the action instead of it only being able to read them from the workflow context.

# Auto-update Custom Fields in Linked Asana Tasks

## What does this do?

This GitHub Action updates a custom field in Asana called "Status" based on specific events related to pull requests (PRs). The updates occur under the following conditions:

- When a PR is merged (or any other push to the main branch).
- When a PR is opened or reopened.

## Development of this GitHub Action

Use GitHub Codespaces to develop this in-browser. There's an existing codespace already set up.

Save your changes and commit the build artifacts:

```
nvm use && npm install && npm run build && npm run package && git add -A && git commit && git push origin main
```

Upon pushing to any branch, you'll trigger an automatic release
